The aim of these exercises is to build a software abstraction of a PCM
system. The outcome of these exercises will be part of the final
examination discussion.

A PCM system can be represented by the cascade of an Analog-to-Digital
converter (ADC), Binary symmetric channel (BSC), and a Digital-to-Analog
converter (DAC) as shown in Figure. The ADC takes an analog signal and converts
to a digital one and the DAC does the opposite. The BSC models the
transmission of the bits representing the analog signal over a channel
which has a certain transition probability $P_e$ of changing the state
of a bit, thus an error.

# Preliminary Questions

-   What are the characteristics parameters of the PCM system?

-   Based on what final aim we decide the system parameters?

-   In fig what is the meaning of $e_Q$ and $e_{BSC}$?

-   What is the quality metric to assess a good reconstruction of the
    analog signal?

# Exercises

1.  Define the class **ADC** with an attribute ****n_bit**** which
    stands for the number of bit of the ADC. Define similarly a class
    BSC which models the binary symmetric channel with a unique
    attribute **error_probability** which stands for the error
    probability $P_e$ of the BSC in case of uniform distribution between
    0s and 1s. Set the attributes in the constructor of the class. In
    both classes write a method or property **snr()** which calculates,
    respectively, the quantization SNR and the SNR of the BSC.

    In the **exercise_1()** function, plot, in dB, the quantization SNR
    for ADC ****n_bit**** = \[2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16\] and the
    BSC SNR for error probability $P_e$ between 1e-12 and 1.

    *Hint*: you can write the SNR methods to accept both single or
    multiple values using numpy arrays. When creating the numpy array
    use the **dtype** parameter to int64 to avoid number representation
    overflow (see numpy documentation). Plot the SNRs on the y-axis and
    **n_bit** and $P_e$ on the x-axis. For $P_e$, set the x-axis in
    logarithmic scale (use **plt.xscale(\"log\")**).

2.  Define a class PCM which models the the PCM system block diagram of
    Fig.[1](#fig:my_label){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:my_label"}. The PCM class attributes are:

    -   **analog_bandwidth**: a float number representing the analog
        signal bandwidth (in Hz) to be digitized, transmitted and
        reconstructed. Set it to an arbitrary value for the moment.

    -   **adc**: an ADC class object, whose number of bits is provided
        as constructor input argument.

    -   **bsc**: a BSC class object, whose error probability is provided
        as constructor input argument.

    We neglect the DAC as we consider perfect analog signal
    reconstruction.

    Write a method **snr()** of the PCM system class which computes the
    overall SNR due to the cascade of ADC and BSC.

    Write a method **critical_pe()** of the PCM system class which
    computes the critical error probability $P_{th}$.

    Consider the possible number of bits array ****n_bit**** = \[2, 4,
    8, 16\] and the error probability $P_e$ between 1e-12 and 1. For
    each number of bit configuration , plot in the same figure the
    overall SNR (y-axis) vs the $P_e$ (x-axis, logarithmic scale). For
    each **n_bit** configuration, add an horizontal line of the
    quantization SNR and a vertical line of the critical error
    probability $P_{th}$.

    *Hint*: Use different line colors to distinguish between the
    different **n_bit** cases. You can use the pyplot functions
    **plt.axhline()** and **plt.axvline()** to plot constant horizontal
    and vertical lines. Although we have seen a closed formula for the
    overall PCM system SNR, remember that it can be calculated as the
    parallel (in linear units) of the quantization and BSC SNRs:

    $$SNR_{TOT} = \left( \frac{1}{SNR_Q} + \frac{1}{SNR_{BSC}} \right)^{-1}$$

3.  Consider now an analog signal whose bandwidth is of 22 KHz. After
    the ideal reconstruction at the DAC output we want to obtain a
    quantization SNR of at least 80 dB. The digitized signal after the
    ADC is transmitted through a BSC whose error probability is
    $P_e = 3.8e-7$.
